This builds the sock up the back of the foot (along the achillies tendon). When finished, the sock has a \"cup\" around the back of the foot, and you are ready to knit around the let. \n",
    "1. Cuff: Finish the sock by knitting ribbing around the top for a few rows. This makes the top of the sock \"stretchy\" so it's easy to put on and stayes in place. "
