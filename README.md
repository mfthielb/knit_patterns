A set of Python Base Classes for Knitting Pattern Calculations

Knitting is a popular hobby, but it's also a practical one. 
People who are not sized according to social norms ("wide" feet, "thick" waists, "short" legs, etc)
can knit their own garments to fit their own bodies comfortably. 

One of my personal favorites is knitting socks. My feet are short and wide, and it is hard to find 
socks that fit. 

Knitting calculations can be tedious--especially if you want to modify a pattern to fit your "nonstandard" body.

These classes are meant to be base classes that a knitter can use to make the tedious part of knitting calculations automatic, leaving more time for the fun parts.
