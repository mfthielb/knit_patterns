# Knitting Patterns
A set of Python Base Classes for Knitting Pattern Calculations

Knitting is a popular hobby, but it's also a practical one. 
People who are not sized according to social norms ("wide" feet, "thick" waists, "short" legs, etc)
can knit their own garments to fit their bodies comfortably. 

Knitting calculations can be tedious--especially if you want to modify a pattern to fit your "nonstandard" body.

These classes are meant to be base classes that a knitter can use to make the tedious part of knitting calculations automatic, leaving more time for the fun parts. 

One of my personal favorite garments to knit is socks. The example classes are implemented as a toe-up sock pattern to demonstrate how the calculators work in practice.  

# How to Read the Code
The demonstrate_classes.ipynb notebook in examples has a high-level explanation of the classes and how they work.
